# Sustainable Image Optimization with CDN & Browser Extension

A system that detects and optimizes unnecessarily heavy images by redirecting them through a CDN server, converting them to lighter formats like WebP, and providing real‚Äëtime impact visualization. The project consists of a browser extension, a CDN server, and a dashboard to track environmental and performance benefits. This project was developed as part of the Lab of Social Impact of Computing course at Trento University, Italy.

## üåç Project Overview

Many websites serve images in outdated or excessively high‚Äëquality formats, leading to unnecessary data transfer, increased energy consumption, and slower load times. This system addresses these issues by:

- **Intercepting image requests** via a browser extension that dynamically injects a unique, anonymous client ID.
- **Redirecting images** through a CDN server that optimizes them.
- **Converting images** into more efficient formats (e.g., WebP) only when the conversion produces smaller file sizes.
- **Persisting and tracking statistics** over time (including per‚Äëuser usage) to evaluate data savings and overall sustainability impact.
- **Visualizing real‚Äëtime insights** in a dashboard with human‚Äëreadable formats (e.g., bytes in KB/MB, energy in kJ/MJ, and time in minutes/hours).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **CDN Server:**
  Express.js, Sharp, Socket.IO, Fetch API
  *(Persists overall stats and a time-series history to JSON files for moderate, single‚Äëinstance usage. For production, a database or cloud storage service is recommended.)*

- **Browser Extension:**
  WebExtensions API (Manifest V3), Declarative Net Request, chrome.storage
  *(Generates a random anonymous client ID to track unique usage while preserving privacy.)*

- **Dashboard:**
  Chart.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
  *(Displays key metrics with human‚Äëreadable formatting and a slider to navigate historical data.)*
