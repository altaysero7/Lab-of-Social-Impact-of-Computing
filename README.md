# Sustainable Image Optimization with CDN & Browser Extension

A system that detects and optimizes unnecessarily heavy images by redirecting them through a CDN server, converting them to lighter formats like WebP, and providing real-time impact visualization. The project consists of a browser extension, a CDN server, and a dashboard to track the environmental and performance benefits. This project is developed as part of the "Lab of Social Impact of Computing" course at the University of Trento, Italy.

## üåç Project Overview

Many websites serve images in outdated or excessively high‚Äëquality formats, resulting in unnecessary data transfer, increased energy consumption, and slower page loads. This system addresses these issues by:

- **Intercepting Image Requests:**
  The browser extension intercepts image requests using the Declarative Net Request API (Manifest V3) and dynamically injects a unique, anonymized client ID to track usage in a privacy‚Äëfriendly manner.

- **Optimizing Images via a CDN Server:**
  The CDN server (built with Express.js, Sharp, Socket.IO, and Node‚ÄëFetch) fetches the original image, converts it to a more efficient format (WebP), and only serves the converted image if it reduces file size. Otherwise, it falls back to serving the original image.

- **Real‚ÄëTime Dashboard:**
  A dashboard (built with Chart.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) visualizes key metrics over time, such as total bytes saved, energy saved (in Joules), sustainability equivalents (e.g., LED bulb runtime, smartphone charges, laptop runtime), performance improvements, and user statistics (unique users and images processed per user).

- **Persistent Statistics:**
  All key statistics and historical data (for charting) are persisted to files on the server. (Note: For multi‚Äëinstance or long‚Äëterm production use, a database or cloud storage solution is recommended.)

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **CDN Server:**
  Express.js, Sharp, Socket.IO, Node‚ÄëFetch
  _Persistent file‚Äëbased storage for overall stats and history._

- **Browser Extension:**
  WebExtensions API (Manifest V3), Declarative Net Request, chrome.storage
  _Generates a unique, anonymized client ID for each installation to track usage without compromising privacy._

- **Dashboard:**
  Chart.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS
  _Displays real‚Äëtime and historical performance, energy, and user metrics._

- **Deployment:**
  Render (public hosting)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup
- **1Ô∏è‚É£ Set Up the CDN Server**
  Clone the repository
  git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sustainable-image-optimization.git cd sustainable-image-optimization/cdn-server
  Install dependencies
  npm install
  Run the CDN server
  node server.js
  Access the dashboard at http://localhost:3000/dashboard
- **2Ô∏è‚É£ Install the Browser Extension**
  Open Chrome (or any Chromium-based browser).

  Navigate to chrome://extensions/.

  Enable Developer mode (top-right corner).

  Click Load Unpacked and select the browser-extension folder.

  The extension will now redirect image requests to the CDN!

## üìä How It Works
Image Interception & Redirection:
The browser extension intercepts image requests and redirects them to the CDN server with a dynamically injected client ID.

Image Optimization:
The CDN server fetches the original image, converts it to WebP (if the conversion reduces file size), and serves the smaller image‚Äîthus saving bytes and energy.

Statistics & History:
The server keeps track of:

Total original bytes, converted bytes, and bytes saved.

Energy saved (Joules) and equivalent metrics (e.g., LED bulb runtime, smartphone charges, laptop runtime).

Performance metrics such as time saved and conversion rate.

Per‚Äëuser statistics using anonymous client IDs.

A complete history of stats for charting over time.

Dashboard Visualization:
The dashboard displays these metrics in real‚Äëtime with human‚Äëreadable formatting. Historical data is persisted, so even after a restart, previous data is loaded and shown on the chart.
